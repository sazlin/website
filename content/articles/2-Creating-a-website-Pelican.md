Summary: How to use Python to create a free personal blog & website

##Creating a Blog with Python
Up until May I had been a Program Manager at Microsoft for nearly 7 years. After much reflection over the past year I decided that I want to get back into Development full time. Being a Microsoft PM will teach you a lot about how to ship great software, but it won't teach you how to code (at least not in the Office org). I already know how to code from school 
###Why Python?
The short answer: I'm in a Python Development Accelerator at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA. My professional goal right now is to immerse myself in all things Python and become an expert in the language. Python is excellent for creating web sites with frameworks such as Flask and Django, so why not use it to make a blog?
###My goals for my blog
I had some general goals in mind when picking a blog platform to migrate to. It's well worth your time to take a minute and think through what it is you want out of your blog before making any big decisions. Here were my goals:
 
* Create a site where I can share professional articles, tutorials, and other musings with the world
* Have that site be easy to setup and maintain
* Make it easy to author posts for the site, including when I'm offline
* Exercise my Python and web dev skills
* Spend as little money as possible
###The key components I settled on
###Step 1: Install Pelican
###Step 2: Deploy to GitHub.io
###Step 3: Install Pelican-Bootstrap3
###Step 4: Pick a Bootstrap Theme you like
###Step 5: Install Pelican-Plugins
###Step 6: Pick a plugin that you like
