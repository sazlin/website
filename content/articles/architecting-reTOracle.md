##Enabling sentiment analysis for reTOracle.com 
In a [previous blog post](), I outlined what [reTOracle.com](http://reTOracle.com) is and hinted at what we were planning to work on next. Since I wrote that post we've enabled sentiment analysis on the Tweets we visualize with reTOracle, bringing us one giant step forward towards reTOracle's future. 

In this blog post I'll walk through how we tackled the challenge of performing sentiment analysis on ten's of thousands of Tweets in near-real time.
